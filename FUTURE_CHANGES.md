Future Changes

A practical, high‑impact roadmap to evolve PM_Intern from a rule-based prototype into a robust, mobile-first, AI-light recommender that is reliable at scale and accessible across India.

## TL;DR (Crux)
- Always surface 3–5 best internships with clear reasons (skills match, distance, stipend) in a mobile-first UI with regional languages.
- Personalize with a lightweight feedback loop (likes/dislikes) and semantic re-ranking; keep infra simple.
- Make location bulletproof with a curated India cities dataset (offline-first) and state-first selection.
- Enable application flows end-to-end: detail pages, applying with a built resume, and simple employer tools.
- Migrate to MongoDB Atlas, add minimal background jobs, logging, and analytics to learn and iterate.

## Alignment to Problem Statement
- Simple, low-text, mobile-compatible experience usable by first-time applicants.
- 3–5 tailored recommendations backed by transparent reasons.
- Regional language support and low-bandwidth mode to reduce friction.
- Lightweight deployment with predictable costs and simple integration surfaces.

## Requested Features (User’s List)

### 1) Like/Dislike system integrated into the recommendation model
- Data model: `interactions`
  - Shape: `{ _id, candidate_id, internship_id, action: 'like'|'dislike', created_at }`
- API
  - `POST /api/interactions` → upsert latest action per (candidate, internship)
  - `GET /api/interactions/:candidate_id` → current likes/dislikes
  - Auth: session or header-based username; rate limit to prevent abuse
- Ranking integration
  - Base score: current skills overlap
  - Boost: shared skills/org with liked items; slight recency bonus
  - Downrank/hide: disliked items
  - Add light distance penalty; optional stipend bonus
- UI
  - Buttons on cards: 👍 Like / 👎 Dislike (toggle, idempotent)
  - Optional filters: “Show liked”, “Hide disliked”
- Acceptance criteria
  - Quick response (<200ms server-side), idempotent updates, improved CTR on top results

### 2) Resume builder from profile
- Input: Profile fields (name, education, skills, sector interests, city/state)
- Generation: Template-driven (no heavy AI)
  - Skill bullets by sector using curated snippets
  - Optional “tailor to internship” mode (insert internship title/skills)
- Export: Client-side PDF (jsPDF) or server-side (WeasyPrint/ReportLab)
- UX: One-click “Build Resume” on profile, inline edit, download
- Acceptance criteria: >70% successful generation, <60s to resume

### 3) Private internship pages + apply flow
- Pages: `/internship/:id` with summary, skills, distance, stipend, apply CTA
- Apply: “Apply with my profile/resume”
  - Save application: `{ _id, candidate_id, internship_id, resume_version, created_at, status: 'submitted'|'shortlisted'|'rejected' }`
  - Optional upload alternate PDF
- Acceptance criteria: Smooth navigation from list → detail → apply, high completion rate

### 4) Employer portal: view applicants and select
- Employer auth (simple)
- Their internships, applicants table (profile snapshot + resume link)
- Actions: shortlist/reject, CSV export
- Audit: who changed what & when

### 5) Regional languages implementation
- Message catalogs (JSON) for: en, hi, pa, bn, te, ta, kn, ml, mr, gu (start with 3–4)
- Language toggle; store choice in localStorage
- Use icons/visual cues to minimize text; ensure fonts render crisply on Android

### 6) Database shift to MongoDB Atlas
- .env-based config; migrate collections & indexes
- Backups; VPC peering (later); minimal cost on free tier initially
- Keep JSON fallback for dev/offline demos

---

## Fixes (User’s List)

### A) Location errors for minor cities
- Curated gazetteer: `data/cities.in.json` with `{ state, city, lat, lon, aliases, type }`
- Append-only runtime cache: `data/city_coords.json` (stop appending to `.py`)
- State-first UI and strict compare; accept place types: `city, town, municipality, census_town, nagar_panchayat, village, suburb, locality, hamlet`
- When not found: suggest 3 nearest “famous” cities in same state

### B) Mobile responsiveness
- Mobile-first layout, 44px touch targets, sticky CTA, skeleton loaders
- Trim text; badges/icons; light/dark modes on low-end devices
- Lighthouse mobile score: >90 across Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices

## Additional High-Impact Ideas (Suggestions)

### Hybrid matching (semantic + rules)
- Keep skill overlap as precise filter; re-rank with embeddings (Sentence-BERT MiniLM) for titles/descriptions/skills
- Cache embeddings in Atlas; cosine similarity for top-N re-rank

### Multi-objective ranking
- Score factors: skills, distance/travel time (optional OSRM), stipend, recency, liked org/skills
- Start with weights; later learn from feedback

### Feedback-driven personalization
- Use likes/dislikes, clicks, applies to build priors per user
- Bandit-style re-ordering (very light) for top candidates

### Saved searches + weekly digest
- Users save criteria; weekly SMS/email with 3 best new matches

### Explainability chips
- Show “Matched 4/6 skills • 12 km away • ₹X stipend” on cards

### Low-bandwidth mode
- Toggle hides images, defers non-critical JS, compresses assets

### Trust & safety
- Employer “verified” badge; clear stipend/remote; source transparency

### Data pipeline & dedup
- Ingest feeds; canonicalize schema; deduplicate via heuristics + embeddings

### Candidate enrichment
- Optional resume upload → parse skills; GitHub/portfolio import; micro-assessments

### Guidance for growth
- Gap analysis to reach target roles; curated learning links; multilingual support

### Accessibility for low digital literacy
- Audio-guided wizard; one-question-per-screen
- SMS/WhatsApp sharable links to top 3 recs
- District-first browsing shortcuts: Near me / My district / My state capital

### Community & fairness
- Opt-in mentors (10-minute calls/webinars)
- Fairness checks to avoid regional/language bias; occasional diversity rotation in recs

## Minimal Data Models (Draft)
- profiles: `{ candidate_id, name, education_level, field_of_study, skills_possessed[], sector_interests[], location_preference, state_preference, created_at }`
- internships: `{ internship_id, title, organization, location, state, skills_required[], sector, stipend, description, created_at }`
- interactions: `{ _id, candidate_id, internship_id, action, created_at }`
- applications: `{ _id, candidate_id, internship_id, resume_version, created_at, status }`
- cities (JSON): `{ state, city, lat, lon, aliases[], type }`

---

## API Contracts (Sketch)
- `POST /api/interactions` → { ok, state } | 400/401
- `GET /api/interactions/:candidate_id` → { likes[], dislikes[] }
- `GET /api/internships` → { internships[] }
- `GET /api/internship/:id` → { internship }
- `POST /api/apply` → { ok, application_id }
- `GET /api/employer/internships` → { internships[] }
- `GET /api/employer/internships/:id/applicants` → { applicants[] }

---

## Success Metrics
- Usage: % users who complete profile; resume generation success rate; application completion rate
- Quality: CTR on top 3 recs; % liked vs disliked; employer shortlist rate
- Reliability: P95 API latency; geocoding success rate; mobile Lighthouse scores

---

## Risks & Mitigations
- Geocoding reliability → Use curated cities JSON + cache; suggest nearest major cities
- Bandwidth constraints → Low-bandwidth mode; small bundles; offline-first UI where possible
- Data quality of internships → Dedup + verification badge; visible source
- Privacy → Explicit consent for resume sharing; redact PII by default; secure storage

---

## Next Steps (Actionable)
1. Implement interactions API + UI toggles and rank boost
2. Add resume builder (template + PDF) on profile page
3. Create internship detail page + apply endpoint & model
4. Migrate DB to MongoDB Atlas and add indexes
5. Introduce cities.in.json + runtime cache and update validation flow
6. Ship multilingual v1 (pick 3 locales), then mobile polish checklist
