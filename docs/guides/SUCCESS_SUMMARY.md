### 🔧 **HOW TO RUN**

#### **Method 1: New Modern Way** ⭐ (Recommended)
```bash
python run.py                    # Default development mode
python run.py --env production   # Production mode  
python run.py --port 8000       # Custom port
python run.py --debug           # Enable debug mode
```

#### **Method 2: With Virtual Environment** 
```bash
"D:/College Work/Coding Prep/PM_Intern/venv/Scripts/python.exe" run.py
```

#### **Method 3: Legacy Way** (Still works)
```bash
python -m backend.app
```
